# Data Engineering Playground

This is a repository that I use to play with data and advance my data engineering skills.
<br>
Some technologies that I plan to use are:
- Spark
- Kafka
- NoSQL
- GraphDB
- ...and so on, the list continues.

I usually use data from kaggle, or official websites. I only use data with reasonable level of creditability.
